General:

- Your computer should be connected to the wifi FF1RoadNet:
	Router IP address: 192.168.1.1
	Password: fortisspi

- Based on the color of their frame, the 5 rovers at our disposal are assigned the following names:  bluerover, blackrover, whiterover, orangerover, redrover.

- In the following instructions, please replace <rovername> with the name of the rover you want to deploy on.

- For Windows users: You might not be able to use the rover names. There are two possible options:
	1) use the corresponding IP address. These are given at the end of this file.
	2) google for MDNS support on windows. You might have to install some software to support it.

Generate Code:
- In af3:
	- open the model for which you want the generated code to be deployed
	- expand the node "Allocations"
	- from "Components -> Hardware", right-click and select "Run Bare Metal Generator"
	- save in the folder "AF3-Project-Directory" (this will create a RaspberryPi folder)

Deploy Code:
- Turn the rover on (it will automatically connect to the router)
- Turn the joystick on
- Copy the generated folder "RaspberryPi" inside the folder "scripts" of the git repo (replace previous one)
- Enter the folder "scripts"
- Execute the script "removeRGB.sh"
- Execute the command "deploy.sh <rovername>.local" 
	- In case you have windows you might not be able to use the name of the rover. In this case use the IPs of the rover provided below.
	- You might get the warning: "The authenticity of host ... can't be established."
	- Proceed anyway and follow the instructions on screen (you will be required to enter the password several times)
- Connect to the rover: 
	- execute the command "ssh pi@<rovername>.local"
	- Password: fortisspi
(In order to run ssh on Windows, you might want to install putty.)

In the shell that opens, type:
- cd SS19
- ./build/RaspberryPI.run
